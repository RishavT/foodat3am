# Food at 3 am
This repository contains all the food recipes that I've designed.

Link to my [blog](http://foodat3am.wordpress.com/)

### Why a Git repo?
 I develop my recipes after lot of hit and trial, lot of iterations. Just like code that I develop. So I thought of using a Git repository to maintain my recipes, just as I maintain my code. If I want to remember what I had used for the first time to make the *Half Melted Chicken Egg Omelette*, it'll be so much easier to just jump to a commit instead of searching through my full computer manually, haha. Plus any suggestions are welcome (fork my repo, haha)!

 And lastly, I wanted this to be open source. you may do whatever it is that you want with these recipes, I'm totally cool! Check out LICENSE.md for more details.
