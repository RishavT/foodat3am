### Equipment needed:

A Frying Pan
Something to heat up the frying pan.
Ingredients:

1. Two eggs
2. Two boiled chicken hot dogs. (You may use flavored sausages for better taste, pepper flavored ones being my favorite. I'd also like to try this out with pork some day. In fact to add a bit of flavor to your sausages, you may add some pepper, garlic, salt etc to the water you boil it in).
3. Salt - to taste
4. Pepper - I prefer using whole black pepper, we'd need approximately 6 pieces of those.
5. Oregano (optional).
6. Butter - 2 tbsp.
7. Olive oil - 1 tbsp.

### Method:

1. Chop the chicken hotdogs into small pieces, about 1cm * 0.25 cm * 0.25 cm.
2. In a frying pan, heat 1 tbsp of olive oil.
3. Once the oil is hot, add some salt (about 1/2 tsp should do), and crush and sprinkle three balls, grains, whatever.. of whole black pepper. *
4. Add the chicken. Fry on low heat for about 5-10 minutes, till the edges start getting brown.
5. While the chicken fries, beat the two eggs in a bowl. Add a tsp of salt, 3 balls of pepper (freshly crushed), and some oregano if you want. Mix well.
6. One the chicken is done frying, the butter into the pan. Let it melt and get all bubbly.
7. Add the eggs, stir the contents of the pan with a spatula a bit. Cook on low heat for 3 minutes.
8. Now the top of the omelette should be slightly runny, whereas the bottom should be well set. Fold the omelette with the spatula, closing it partially.
9. Cook for another 1-2 minutes on medium flame, till you feel the texture is perfect (I prefer somewhere in the middle of fully set and very runny), and the edges of the omelette are light brown.
10. Done! Switch off the gas, grab a plate, and eat your half melted chicken omelette.

### Things to keep in mind:

* If you're not sure how much you want the omelette cooked, cook it till it's not breaking apart when you lift it with the spatula, but still leaking.
You may try adding some chopped tomatoes/capsicum as well.
* To crush black pepper easily, I use my plier-like-thing (called 'pakad' in hindi. I have no clue what they call it in english, did not even know what to Google).
